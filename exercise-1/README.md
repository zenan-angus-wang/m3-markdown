# Exercise-1

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you will see the rendered markdown file.

See `complete` branch for an example.

>Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.

>Martin Luther King
